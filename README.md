# W2 wiki

W2 wiki is a web-based, wiki-like notepad that you can host yourself.


## Notable features:

- Elegant text markup:
    - Uses [Markdown Syntax](https://github.com/codeling/w2wiki/blob/master/pages/Markdown Syntax.md); additionally,
    - It supports double-brackets [[like this]] to link to another page in the wiki by title
    - It supports double-braces {{like this}} to link to an uploaded image
- Minimalistic but functional interface:
    - Fits to screen nicely when viewed on iPhone, with custom icon for adding to home screen
    - HTML5 compliant output
- Title & content search
- Filesystem storage (no database required) in plain Markdown text files.
- Rudimentary git integration to commit & push each page edit
- Localization support (currently en/ja translations available)
- Image uploading support
- Optionally password-protected
- Unlike cloud / hosted solutions, you retain control of your data
- Written in PHP for portability and hackability
- Extremely compact (only a few .php files and a .css file)
